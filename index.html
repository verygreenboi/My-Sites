								<p>Hon Sultan Adegbayibi Adeniji Adele II, a barrister, scion of the ADENIJIJ ADELE family of Lagos State, is a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly. His election into the legislative house is a call to service. He has pledged to devote all his energies into becoming an accomplished public servant.</p>
								<p>Married to Sahadat Adeniji Adele, he has stated unequivocally that his battle cry his "Tradition of service" based on his antecedents which impel him to learn from the needs and pains prevailing and strategically focused on truly using himself to sustain hope for the future.</p>
								<p>He is a member of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) representing Amuwo Odofin constituency 1. Having been up and tutored into an environment where service to humanity has being raised his greatness heights, Hon Sultan II, knows that PUBLIC OFFICE MEANS PUBLIC SERVICE. He will therefore make serious efforts to extend human horizon beyond limits, break down barriers and brighten the collective hopes of this generation for the future.
									As a legislator he will seek to continue the ‘Tradition of service’ handed over in the history of Adeniji Adele’s. He is from a family noted for diligence, hard work and unblemished records of service. His grandfather, late Sir Musendiq Adeniji-Adele (M.B.E, O.B.E.), Oba of Lagos (1949-64) was a Deputy President of the Senate of the Federal republic of Nigeria in the 1st republic and a foremost advocate of education irrespective of gender or religion. His father, Prince Ademola Adeniji-Adele, former Chairman of Lagos Island Local Government, former Commissioner for youths and sports under governor Fashola in his 1st term and a civil rights activist, was imprisoned during the struggle for the actualization of June 12th by Abacha. His uncle, Late Sultan Adeniji-Adele I and Aunty Princess Mulikat Adele-Lakanu were at different times Chairpersons of Lagos Island Local Government. </p>
								<p>His party Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) enjoys a lot of good will from the people of Lagos State, through the efforts and achievements of its leaders; like: Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Bisi Akande, Prince Ademola Adeniji Adele, and our own indefatigable BRF, Barrister Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) the present Governor of Lagos State and the man on the moment.
									I pledge to continue this “Tradition of service” to always make Lagos the real centre of excellence.</p>
